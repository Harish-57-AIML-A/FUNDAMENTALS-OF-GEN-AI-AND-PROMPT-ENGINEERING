## 📖 About

This repository is a structured guide to the **fundamentals of Generative AI (Gen AI)** and **Prompt Engineering**. It is designed for students, developers, and AI enthusiasts who want to build a strong foundation in modern AI technologies — particularly large language models (LLMs) and how to communicate with them effectively through well-crafted prompts.

Whether you are new to AI or an experienced developer looking to sharpen your skills, this resource provides clear explanations, practical examples, and curated knowledge to help you navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of Generative AI.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By studying the material in this repository, you will be able to:

- ✅ Understand what Generative AI is and how it works
- ✅ Explain the architecture and training of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- ✅ Apply prompt engineering techniques to get better outputs from AI models
- ✅ Recognize and use different prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, etc.)
- ✅ Understand the ethical considerations and limitations of Gen AI
- ✅ Build practical intuition for working with tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

No deep expertise is required, but familiarity with the following will help:

- 🐍 **Basic Python** — for running code examples
- 💻 **Command Line** — navigating directories, running scripts
- 🌐 **Internet Access** — for API calls to LLM providers (OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- 🤔 **Curiosity** — the most important prerequisite!

> **Recommended:** Create a free account on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) or [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to experiment with the prompts interactively.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harish-57-AIML-A/FUNDAMENTALS-OF-GEN-AI-AND-PROMPT-ENGINEERING.git
   cd FUNDAMENTALS-OF-GEN-AI-AND-PROMPT-ENGINEERING
   ```

2. **Explore the content**
   Browse the folders and files to find topics that interest you. Each section includes notes, examples, and exercises.

3. **Try the prompts**
   Copy any prompt examples into your preferred LLM interface (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and experiment with variations to deepen your understanding.

4. **Learn and iterate**
   Prompt engineering is a hands-on skill — the more you experiment, the better you get! 🚀
